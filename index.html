			<h2>What do you like the most about graphic design?</h2>
			<p>"What I like the most is learning how to do it because you know, not everyone can do it. So I like when people say 'oh shit, you're sick at this.' or 'hey you'll let me know if you're making graphic design posters?' and stuff like that like yeah for sure."</p>

			<h2>What would you say concerns you or worries you the most about graphic design?</h2>
			<p>"What worries me the most is the competition because there's a lot of graphic designers in the world nowadays and a lot of people try to take it seriously. But it's all about if you can bring your own kind of style to the game, that's what will help you succeed in the future."</p>

			<h2>What aspect of graphic design would you say you gravitate towards the most?</h2>
			<p>"Well, in my opinion, I think I would say illustration, like I like making stuff. Um, I'd have to say Photoshop as well, like making different pictures and stuff like that. I like editing pictures, making your own style of picture, re visualizing the picture, stuff like that."</p>

	<section>
		<div class="content">
			<h2>What would you say the main responsibility of a graphic designer is and how does their role fits into society today?</h2>
			<p>"Their role fits in the society through like the visualization of art because I feel that they bring a different concept to the world that other people can't do through photography and stuff like that. I feel that through graphic design we can really express ourselves more than any other kind of art and stuff like that because we have more options we have different programs to actually choose to and everyone can be different about their style and how they wanted to like present that stuff to the world."</p>

	<section>
		<div class="content">
			<h2>So do you think it could be possible for a graphic designer to change the world?</h2>
			<p>"Very possible. It all depends like if they get the opportunity or not because the thing is, it only takes one shot one shot or one opportunity for someone to change the world. So if someone very big were to see you one day they could like look at you and be like, hey, I'm going to give you a chance and then you could like percept it and have to go viral and people could look at you like something different and the whole graphic design game could just change in like a snap and after you know change what happened. Yeah."</p>
